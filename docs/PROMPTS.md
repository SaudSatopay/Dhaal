# Claude Code Session Prompts

> **H9 mid-build prompts are at the bottom** — Parva: visual identity overhaul · Harsh: Sarvam + guardian resolve + hardening. The original kickoff/loop prompts below them are done/superseded.

Each member opens Claude Code **in their own clone of this repo** and pastes their prompt. Saud runs the Kickoff prompt first (right after the problem statements drop); everyone else starts once he pushes the filled docs. Claude auto-reads `CLAUDE.md`, so the rules travel with the repo.

Prerequisites per member (do before the event): Claude Code installed + logged in · repo cloned · `git config user.name` / `user.email` = your GitHub identity · `gh auth login` done (optional but useful).

---

## Prompt 0 — KICKOFF ✅ DONE (executed at kickoff — PS locked: Fintech #7 → Dhaal. Kept for reference only; start with your loop prompt below.)

```
Read CLAUDE.md and all of docs/ first. I'm Saud (@SaudSatopay) — Glue lane and
integration lead. The problem statements are out. Here are the candidates for
our tracks (Healthcare primary, Fintech backup, Supply Chain backup):

--- PROBLEM STATEMENTS (raw paste / photos fine) ---
[PASTE HERE]
--- END ---

Team: 3 of us, each driving our own Claude Code session on this repo in
parallel — Parva (Product: frontend/UX/pitch), Harsh (Engine: backend/AI),
me (Glue: integration/deploy/demo-data/QA). Stack is locked in CLAUDE.md.
Build ends 6:00 AM, judging 11 AM. Winning formula: a narrow end-to-end demo
that never breaks + ONE wow moment (pre-planned: Sarvam Indic voice loop) +
a tight story. If Healthcare: assistive-not-diagnostic framing.

Do this with me, in order:
1. Score each candidate PS on team-fit × demo-ability × differentiation
   (short table, 45-minute decision budget). Recommend one; I make the call.
2. Lock the golden path: the ONE demo flow that must never break, as 6-8
   numbered user steps.
3. Scaffold the monorepo for the locked stack — frontend/ (Next.js + Tailwind
   + shadcn/ui), backend/ (FastAPI), wired to .env.example — a minimal
   hello-world that runs locally AND deploys to Vercel + Railway within 2
   hours. Deploy first, then features.
4. Fill docs/PLAN.md (PS, concept, golden path, architecture, wow layer),
   docs/CONTRACTS.md (data models + every golden-path endpoint + env names),
   docs/TASKS.md (real tasks per lane with hour targets: MVP end-to-end by
   H8, wow layer H8-H12, freeze at H12; mark cross-lane dependencies).
5. Commit + push everything to main, then write me a 3-line kickoff message
   for the team chat: what we're building, who starts on what, first sync.

Commit rules per CLAUDE.md: author is me only, no AI attribution of any kind.
Ask me before adding any paid/signup service. Every external API gets a
mocked fallback.
```

---

## Prompt 1 — SAUD (Glue) — build loop, after kickoff

```
Read CLAUDE.md, then docs/PLAN.md, docs/CONTRACTS.md, docs/TASKS.md.
I'm Saud (@SaudSatopay) — Glue lane: integration, deploys, demo data, QA,
keeping main runnable. Parva (Product/frontend) and Harsh (Engine/backend+AI)
are pushing to main in parallel with their own Claude sessions — expect the
repo to change underneath us constantly.

First: confirm git identity is mine (git config user.name / user.email).
Every commit authors as me — never any AI attribution (CLAUDE.md rules).

My loop — repeat until I say stop:
1. git pull --rebase origin main; re-read TASKS.md + CONTRACTS.md deltas.
2. Check Requests/Blockers addressed to me and clear those FIRST — I'm the
   floater; unblocking Parva/Harsh beats my own tasks.
3. Otherwise claim my next Glue task: mark [WIP-saud] in TASKS.md, push the
   marker immediately.
4. Build it. My lane also means: keep Vercel + Railway deploys green after
   merges, seed realistic demo data, and walk the golden path end-to-end
   every hour — file whatever breaks in TASKS.md.
5. Verify the app runs, commit small ("glue: ..."), pull --rebase, push,
   tick the task, un-WIP.

If main breaks, drop everything and fix it. Cross-lane rebase conflicts:
I arbitrate. From H12 (feature freeze): error-proof the golden path, record
the backup demo video, feed Parva numbers for the PPT, submit 30 min early.
```

## Prompt 2 — PARVA (Product) — build loop

```
Read CLAUDE.md, then docs/PLAN.md, docs/CONTRACTS.md, docs/TASKS.md.
I'm Parva — Product lane: everything under frontend/, UX, demo choreography,
and the pitch deck later. Saud (Glue: integration/deploy) and Harsh (Engine:
backend/AI) are pushing to this repo in parallel with their own Claude
sessions — the repo changes underneath us constantly.

First: confirm git identity — git config user.name / user.email must be MY
name + MY GitHub email (set repo-locally if wrong; ask me for the values).
Every commit authors as me. Never add Co-Authored-By, "Generated with
Claude", or any AI attribution anywhere (CLAUDE.md rules).

My loop — repeat until I say stop:
1. git pull --rebase origin main; re-read TASKS.md + CONTRACTS.md deltas.
2. Claim my next Product task: mark [WIP-parva] in TASKS.md, push the
   marker immediately.
3. Build it mobile-first. Match docs/CONTRACTS.md exactly — if the backend
   endpoint isn't live yet, build against a mock of the contract and swap
   later. Golden-path screens get polish priority over everything else.
4. Verify the app runs, commit small ("frontend: ..."), pull --rebase,
   push, tick the task, un-WIP.
5. Need a backend/API change? Don't touch backend/ — add it under Requests
   in TASKS.md, push, and remind me to ping Harsh.

If a rebase conflict touches files outside frontend/, stop and tell me —
Saud arbitrates. From H12 (feature freeze) my lane pivots: demo
choreography, the PPT (problem → live demo → architecture → impact →
feasibility), and rehearsing the golden path until it's boring.
```

## Prompt 3 — HARSH (Engine) — build loop

```
Read CLAUDE.md, then docs/PLAN.md, docs/CONTRACTS.md, docs/TASKS.md.
I'm Harsh (@harshh-2505) — Engine lane: everything under backend/ — FastAPI,
MongoDB Atlas, and the AI pipelines (Claude API, Sarvam Indic ASR/TTS/
translate, RAG on Atlas Vector Search). Saud (Glue) and Parva (Product/
frontend) are pushing to this repo in parallel with their own Claude
sessions — the repo changes underneath us constantly.

First: confirm git identity — git config user.name / user.email must be MY
name + MY GitHub email (set repo-locally if wrong; ask me for the values).
Every commit authors as me. Never add Co-Authored-By, "Generated with
Claude", or any AI attribution anywhere (CLAUDE.md rules).

My loop — repeat until I say stop:
1. git pull --rebase origin main; re-read TASKS.md + CONTRACTS.md deltas.
2. Claim my next Engine task: mark [WIP-harsh] in TASKS.md, push the marker
   immediately.
3. Contract first: if my task changes an API shape, data model, or env var,
   update docs/CONTRACTS.md (+ .env.example) and push THAT before writing
   the code — Parva builds against it, Saud wires deploys from it.
4. Build it. Every external call (Claude, Sarvam, Atlas) gets a mocked
   fallback behind MOCK_MODE — venue Wi-Fi will die. Golden-path endpoints
   first; the deterministic signal engine IS the product's spine — the LLM
   narrates but never decides a verdict. Wow layer (voice + guardian +
   intel flywheel) is H8–H12, only after MVP works.
5. Verify the API runs, commit small ("backend: ..."), pull --rebase, push,
   tick the task, un-WIP. Secrets in .env only.

If a rebase conflict touches files outside backend/, stop and tell me —
Saud arbitrates. From H12 (feature freeze): harden endpoints, kill flaky
calls, feed Parva real metrics for the PPT.

# H11 PROMPT — PARVA: global language toggle (last pre-freeze feature)

```
Read CLAUDE.md + docs/TASKS.md deltas. I'm Parva — Product lane. Identity check
first; commits as me, no AI attribution.

FEATURE (Saud's ask, timeboxed — freeze is close): a global language toggle so
the whole app runs consistently in ONE language, chosen by the user.

SPEC:
- A हिं / EN pill toggle visible on EVERY page (TopBar + landing header),
  styled inside the poster identity (ink border, saffron active state).
- Persist in localStorage ("dhaal-lang", default "hi"); read on mount, no
  flash — a tiny useLang() hook or context in lib/.
- When EN is selected: UI labels lead in English (labels.ts already has every
  pair — selected language becomes primary, the other drops to the small
  subtitle or hides where space is tight), verdict card shows explanation_en
  (hi when हिं), signal titles/details use *_en fields, runsheet strings
  unaffected.
- Pass the selection through the API calls: lang "hi-IN"/"en-IN" on /api/check
  (drives TTS voice language) and lang_hint on /api/transcribe.
- ZERO contract/API changes needed — every response field is already
  bilingual. Zero logic changes. If a page has hardcoded Hindi strings,
  migrate them into labels.ts pairs.
- npm run build green, walk beats 1-3 in BOTH languages at mobile width,
  commit ("frontend: global language toggle"), push, ping Saud for deploy.
```

# H9 MID-BUILD PROMPTS (current — use these)

## Prompt 4 — PARVA: visual identity overhaul ("suraksha poster, not SaaS dashboard")

```
Read CLAUDE.md, then docs/TASKS.md + docs/CONTRACTS.md deltas. I'm Parva — Product
lane. First: confirm git identity is mine; every commit authors as me, never any AI
attribution (CLAUDE.md rules).

MISSION THIS SESSION: total visual identity overhaul. The app works end-to-end but
looks like every AI-generated Tailwind app ever made — judges will see forty of
those today. Ours must be unmistakable from across the room: bold, artistic,
Indian, and dead-serious about danger.

DESIGN DIRECTION — "suraksha poster, not SaaS dashboard":
- Dhaal is a shield (ढाल). Steal the visual language of Indian public-safety
  signage and hand-painted warning posters — heavy ink, hazard geometry, rubber
  stamps and seals — executed with modern craft, not kitsch.
- Type IS the design. Display: Anek Devanagari 700/800 (via next/font), HUGE
  bilingual lockups — Hindi first, English as the small subtitle underneath.
  Body: Mukta. Numbers/indicators: IBM Plex Mono. Real jumps in the type scale;
  the hero wordmark should feel like a poster, not a heading.
- Token palette, commit to it everywhere: paper #F7F3E8 (warm off-white ground) ·
  ink #14181F · hazard saffron #E8A13B as THE brand accent · verdict colors
  reserved STRICTLY for verdicts (danger #C62828 family · caution amber ·
  clear #2E7D32). Verdict red/green never appears decoratively.
- The VERDICT CARD is the hero artifact of the product:
  * DANGER = a hazard notice: thick ink border, diagonal hazard-stripe header
    band, खतरा enormous, and the community count as a circular rubber-stamp seal
    ("86 रिपोर्ट"), slightly rotated, ink-textured.
  * Verdict reveal = stamp-slam: scale + tiny rotation settling with one heavy
    shadow frame. CSS-only, 250–400ms, honor prefers-reduced-motion.
  * NO_KNOWN_RISK = a calm green clearance chit — quiet and small. Danger
    screams; safety whispers.
- Checking state: a shield "scanning" animation with "जाँच हो रही है…" — never a
  default spinner.
- Landing = poster: massive ढाल wordmark, the one-line promise, ONE giant check
  CTA, live counter as a ticking odometer. No feature-card grid.
- /intel (the projector surface) may go ink-dark war-room — amber accents, mono
  numerals — the ONE deliberate dark surface against the paper-light phone
  surfaces.
- BANNED (anti-slop list): emoji as icons (draw tiny inline SVGs or use
  typographic marks), the rounded-2xl-white-card-on-gray look, blue-600, purple
  gradients, glassmorphism, centered-everything, Inter. If a screen would look at
  home in a template gallery, redo it.

SCOPE + RULES:
- VISUAL refactor only — zero API/contract/logic changes; every flow keeps
  working exactly (paste/QR/voice, report→verify flywheel, guardian pair,
  recover).
- Priority order, timeboxed hard (freeze at H12): 1) verdict card 2) /check
  3) landing 4) /intel 5) guardian + recover get tokens/type applied lightly.
  Ship in that order — commit per surface ("frontend: verdict card — hazard
  identity"), pull --rebase, push, move on.
- Mobile-first always (judges hold phones) + projector legibility (contrast,
  size). npm run build green before every push. No new heavy deps — CSS
  animations only, no motion libraries.
- Done = ping Saud for deploy, then walk runsheet beats 1–3 yourself at mobile
  width.
```

## Prompt 5 — HARSH: Sarvam voice + guardian resolve + hardening

```
Read CLAUDE.md, then docs/TASKS.md + docs/CONTRACTS.md deltas (the keys section
changed). I'm Harsh (@harshh-2505) — Engine lane. Identity check first; every
commit authors as me, never any AI attribution.

STATE: SARVAM_API_KEY is LIVE in root .env and the backend's Vercel prod env
(validated: 200 on /translate). Anthropic + Atlas are already live in prod.
Your fallback architecture stays untouched — auto-fallback on every external
call remains the law.

THIS SESSION, in order (freeze at H12):
1. [P1 H8–H10] Sarvam ASR: make /api/transcribe real — webm/m4a multipart →
   Sarvam speech-to-text (hi-IN, code-mixed). Keep the typed_text passthrough
   and the fixture auto-fallback on any failure (mocked:true). Contract
   unchanged.
2. [P1] Sarvam TTS: /api/check with speak:true → tts_audio_b64 generated from
   explanation_hi. Cache the audio on the stored check so replay is instant.
   Fallback: null audio, never an error.
3. [Guardian polish, contract-first] Add GET
   /api/guardian/links/resolve?pair_code=DHAAL-XXXX → link object (Parva's
   Requests item — enables "ward types the code"). Push the CONTRACTS.md change
   BEFORE the code.
4. [H12+ hardening — start if time] Per-external-call latency log lines
   (claude_ms, sarvam_ms, atlas_ms) — Saud needs real numbers for the PPT.
   Timeouts + retry-once everywhere. Kill anything flaky.
5. Tests: extend run_api_checks with transcribe-multipart (mock mode) and
   resolve-by-code cases. BOTH suites green before every push.

Claim each item on the board ([WIP-harsh], push the marker first). Saud deploys
after you land — ping him. CLAUDE_MODEL env knob exists; leave it on
claude-sonnet-5.
```

# H12 PROMPT — PARVA: the "weeks-of-work" wow pass (final feature window)

```
Read CLAUDE.md + docs/TASKS.md deltas, git pull --rebase FIRST (Saud pushed mic
fixes + build stamp into check/page.tsx and next.config). I'm Parva — Product
lane. Identity check; commits as me, no AI attribution.

MISSION: make Dhaal LOOK like weeks of work at first glance — visible depth,
living data, choreography. Real data only, no fakery. Priority order, commit
per feature, stop at whatever the clock allows:

1. SCAM RADAR LANDING (the first impression):
   Replace the landing hero with a live war-room radar: an India/Rajasthan SVG
   outline (hand-draw simplified path, ink on paper) with PULSING pings sized
   by report count per city from GET /api/intel/trends (cities[] has counts).
   Odometer counters (total verified · live this session · languages · signals
   run). A thin ticker strip: "अभी verify हुआ: <top indicators rotating>".
   CSS-only animation, honor prefers-reduced-motion, poster identity intact.

2. VERDICT THEATER (turns the 5s wait into the wow):
   On /check submit, show the engine "scanning" — a staged sequence of the
   REAL signal rows revealing one by one (150ms stagger, hazard sweep over
   each), score counting up, THEN the stamp-slam verdict. Data is the actual
   response — choreographed reveal, zero invention. The checking state lists
   detector names scrolling (collect-parser · domains · scripts · blocklist…).

3. LIVE THREAT TICKER in TopBar (all pages): rotating line from trends top
   indicators — "⚠ +91-98xxx… · 129 reports · digital arrest". 20 lines of
   code, massive alive-ness.

4. (stretch) /learn — "ठग को पहचानो" simulator: 5 rounds, real fixture
   messages (mix scam/legit from lib/fixtures), user guesses, Dhaal reveals
   verdict + signals, score at end + "अपना inbox जाँचो" CTA. Pure frontend +
   /api/check calls.

RULES: zero API/contract changes · poster identity (no new colors) · mobile-
first · npm run build green before every push · walk beats 1-3 after each
feature · freeze discipline: if midnight hits, finish the commit you're on,
nothing new after.
```
